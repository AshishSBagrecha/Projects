Left over food delivery system
- In Marriages or any kind of feast there are left overs which eventually get thrown away in dustbin , instead of that if we can give details about food items and address of the event ,there can be a delivery guy who can pick it up and deliver to the tied-up NGOs. (From similar idea from Sylvia -
Indian weddings are known for their lavish food spreads and the quantity of food as well.  Only very few people donate the left over food from weddings to charity houses or homes for the poor.  If there is a way to connect wedding halls with homes for the poor nearby who sign up for it, that will be a great way to ensure free food is distributed to the homeless.)&#34;
